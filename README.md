# Imbalanced-Learning-Using-ML-Models-and-Sampling-Techniques
This project uses machine learning models with sampling techniques, including Random Undersampling, Cluster Centroids, Random Oversampling, and SMOTE, to tackle imbalanced classification problems. We evaluate model performance using F1-score and AUROC to ensure we effectively predict the minority class.
